The UK Asian Community Cup is a football festival which London Tigers has been organising since 2003. This year it is at Crystal Palace FC and sponsored by the Canary Wharf Group Plc.
This festival has created a pathway for Asians towards mainstream football and provided a platform for amateur Asian teams to display local talented players to others. This also provides them with an opportunity to play in a premier league stadium.
The Cup is a nationwide tournament involving hundreds of footballers from Asian communities and uses the power of football to help strengthen bonds between communities.
London Tigers is an award winning charity that works across London and beyond to engage disadvantaged communities in improving their lives through upskilling people, keeping communities safe, improving health and wellbeing, providing sporting pathways and international humanitarian aid. Our vision is a a world where every individual has the opportunity to fulfil their dreams.";s:6:"t0_c18";s:54:"/images/upload/e4/e4e21abf0a3144087700b6bf6dc1bbc6.jpg";s:6:"t0_c19";s:19:"2017-06-12 16:56:35";s:6:"t0_c20";s:1:"1";s:6:"t0_c21";s:1:"1";s:6:"t0_c22";s:1:"3";s:6:"t0_c23";s:11:"51.39830890";s:6:"t0_c24";s:11:"-0.08817280";s:6:"t0_c25";s:2:"49";s:6:"t0_c26";s:7:"5145349";s:6:"t0_c27";s:7:"4243024";s:6:"t0_c28";s:1:"5";s:6:"t0_c29";s:14:"United Kingdom";s:6:"t0_c30";s:11:"Ab Kettleby";s:6:"t0_c31";s:0:"";s:6:"t0_c32";s:163:"UK Asian Community Cup Final 2017 - Whats On Come and join the celebrations in the Cup Final of the UK Asian Community Cup 2017 taking place on Thursday 18th May.
